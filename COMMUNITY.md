# Community Guidelines

For all project participation, please review:

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for behavior expectations
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` for pull request and contribution workflow
- `SUPPORT.md` for help and bug-report guidance
- `SECURITY.md` for responsible vulnerability reporting

## Collaboration Norms

- Optimize for clarity and technical correctness.
- Keep discussions specific and evidence-based.
- Prefer small, incremental changes over large speculative rewrites.
- Document decisions that affect APIs, provider behavior, or reliability.
